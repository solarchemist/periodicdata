<!-- badges: end -->

This is an R *data* package with data in YAML format (for ease of entry and to
more easily keep track of metadata) including necessary R code to import said
data into a rectangularized tibble.

The dataset contains around 70 properties of the chemical elements.
The package has two vignettes; the first demonstrates how the YAML file is read
and saved into the tibble exported by this package, the second show-cases how
the data can be used to visualize different properties on the canvas of the
periodic table.

My hope is that this package will make it easier for chemists, teachers, and anyone
interested in chemistry to generate periodic tables of whatever trend they wish
to visualize.

## Package vignettes

+ [Vignette #1: Importing data from YAML](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/solarchemist/periodicdata/blob/master/doc/periodicdata.html)
+ [Vignette #2: Show-case of data visualizations](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/solarchemist/periodicdata/blob/master/doc/showcase.html)



## Install this package

To install this package:
```
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("solarchemist/periodicdata")
```

To also build the vignettes when installing this package,
modify the last line to:
```
remotes::install_github("solarchemist/periodicdata", build_opts = c("--no-resave-data", "--no-manual"), build_vignettes = TRUE)
```


## Properties in this dataset

This list of all the properties in this dataset is dynamically
generated from the YAML dataset every time the vignette is rebuilt:
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, results="asis"}
source(here::here("vignettes/code/generate-markdown.R"), local = knitr::knit_global())
```


## Contribute to this package

Your contributions are most welcome! Please report corrections as an issue or PR.

To add more data to the dataset, check out this repository and edit the YAML file
`inst/extdata/periodicdata.yml`.

To rebuild the package, I recommend you run the provided bash script in `tools/`.
You will of course need **R**. Other rebuild requirements are

+ [`yq`](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq), and
+ renv (use renv and the provided `renv.lock` file to install required R packages).


To checkout this repository:
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
$ git clone https://github.com/solarchemist/periodicdata.git
```

To rebuild the package after having made edits to YAML:
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
$ rebuild_package.sh --refresh-data
```

The rebuild script has more functionality; use the `--help` flag or read its
source code to familiarize yourself.

As part of the rebuild procedure `R CMD check` runs and should complete
without any errors, warnings, or notes.



## Other works citing this package

It is not really possible for me to keep track of how anyone uses this package,
nor do I have such an intention. But if you feel like letting me know how
you made use of this data or visualizations in your teaching or work, I will
gladly list you here!

## Package history

I released this package in 2019 spurred by the International Year of Chemistry
([#IYPT2019](https://www.iypt2019.org)), building mostly on earlier work which
I had until then not packaged:

+ [Properties of the elements: data collection and ggplot2 tables](https://solarchemist.se/2014/11/16/element-data), Ahmed (2014)
+ [All available elemental properties plotted as periodic tables](https://solarchemist.se/2015/01/30/element-properties), Ahmed (2015)

These original web scraping scripts are preserved as package *articles* in the
vignettes directory, but no longer fill any role in maintaining this dataset.
