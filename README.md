# Periodic data

We have scraped a dataset consisting of all chemical elements and around 80 properties and placed them in a more easily accessible format.

This R package includes two vignettes that demonstrate a few different approaches to construct the periodic table and how to plot a property.
Our hope is that this package will make it easier for chemists and others interested in the chemical sciences to generate periodic tables of whatever trend they wish to visualise.

This package was based on some of my old projects (see Earlier work below).
But I reworked most of the code in honour of the [#IYPT2019](https://www.iypt2019.org/) and released it as an R package.

![IUPAC periodic table](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chepec/periodicdata/master/doc/periodictable-ggplot.png)



## So what can this package do?

Please [have a look at the vignette](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/chepec/periodicdata/blob/master/doc/periodicdata.html).
You might also like to skim through these blog posts that demonstrate some more examples:

+ [Properties of the elements: data collection and ggplot2 tables](https://chepec.se/2014/11/16/element-data/)
+ [All available elemental properties plotted as periodic tables](https://chepec.se/2015/01/30/element-properties/)



## Install this package

To install this package on your system, I suggest: 

```
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("chepec/periodicdata")
```

Note that `devtools` [does not build vignettes by default](https://github.com/r-lib/devtools/issues/1896) 
[when installing packages](https://stackoverflow.com/a/33617870/1198249). 
To build the vignette when installing this package, replace the last line above with

```
devtools::install_github("chepec/periodicdata", build_opts = c("--no-resave-data", "--no-manual"), build_vignettes = TRUE)
```


## Develop this package

To check out the source code (perhaps to work on the code and contribute code back ;-), you should `git clone`. Note that this does not tell your R anything about the package.

```
git clone https://github.com/chepec/periodicdata.git
```


## Contributions welcome

If you would like to add to this dataset you're very welcome. Open an issue or a pull request.

And please let me know if you find any errors in the data or the code.
